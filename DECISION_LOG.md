# Decision Log

Non-obvious engineering decisions made throughout the project, in
chronological order. Each entry: decision, reason, alternatives considered,
trade-off.

## 2026-09-09 — Project structure follows the provided architecture spec exactly

**Decision:** Use the directory layout from
`Hiver_SDE_Project_Architecture_for_Claude_Code.md` section 4 verbatim
(`src/{data,intents,retrieval,generation,escalation}`, `baselines/`,
`evaluation/`, `scripts/`, `app/`, `tests/`, `artifacts/`, `docs/`).

**Reason:** The spec was clearly designed so each pipeline stage
(classification, retrieval, generation, escalation) is independently
testable and explainable, which matters for a live interview walkthrough.

**Alternatives considered:** A flatter `src/` with fewer subpackages — rejected
because it would blur the boundary between components the assignment
explicitly wants kept separate (see architecture doc section 25).

**Trade-off:** More boilerplate `__init__.py`/folders up front for a project
that starts empty, in exchange for a structure that won't need reshuffling
later.

## 2026-09-09 — Centralized config via `src/config.py` + `.env`, no per-module env reads

**Decision:** All environment-variable-driven settings (API keys, model
names, thresholds, paths, random seed) are read once into a frozen
`Settings` dataclass in `src/config.py`, exposed as a module-level `settings`
singleton.

**Reason:** The assignment requires configurable thresholds (not hard-coded)
and reproducible seeds; centralizing this in one place makes it auditable
and prevents drift where different modules read the same env var
differently.

**Alternatives considered:** `pydantic-settings` — deferred for now since
`pydantic` is already a dependency for later structured-output schemas, but
a plain frozen dataclass is simpler to explain live and has no additional
dependency surface for Phase 0.

**Trade-off:** Slightly less validation than a pydantic `BaseSettings` model
would give (e.g. no automatic type coercion errors), acceptable at this
stage since there are few settings.

## 2026-09-09 — golden set data path is git-tracked; raw/processed data paths are not

**Decision:** `.gitignore` excludes `data/raw/*` and `data/processed/*.{jsonl,csv}`
but leaves `data/golden/` untouched so the golden evaluation set can be
committed once created.

**Reason:** Raw Twitter data and large processed derivatives shouldn't be
committed (repo size, licensing), but the 150–250-example golden set is a
required deliverable and needs to ship with the repo for reproducibility.

**Alternatives considered:** Committing a small processed data subset too —
deferred to Phase 20 (reproducibility check), where the exact
evaluation-ready subset to ship will be decided.

**Trade-off:** None for the golden set once labeled — this only needs
noting in case it's obscured by `.gitignore` later.

## 2026-09-09 — Two-pass streaming scan instead of loading the full 2.8M-row CSV

**Decision:** `scripts/inspect_dataset.py` scans the raw CSV twice in
200k-row chunks: Pass A reads only `author_id`/`inbound`/`in_response_to_tweet_id`
to cheaply rank all 108 brand accounts by volume and pick a shortlist; Pass B
reads all columns once to compute global data-quality stats (missing values,
duplicates, date range) and buffers only the shortlisted brands' rows for
detailed per-brand stats and conversation sampling.

**Reason:** The full file is 516MB / 2.8M rows. Ranking brands first with a
narrow column read is fast (~10s) and lets the expensive full-column pass
avoid holding anything beyond a handful of brands' worth of rows in memory
(the buffered subset is a small fraction of the full dataset).

**Alternatives considered:** Loading the whole file into one DataFrame —
would likely still fit in memory on most machines (~2-3GB), but violates the
explicit instruction not to load the full dataset when a chunked approach is
straightforward, and would not generalize if the dataset were larger.

**Trade-off:** Two passes means the file is read from disk twice
(~2.5 minutes total on this machine) instead of once. Considered acceptable
since this script is run rarely (during inspection/setup), not in any hot path.

## 2026-09-09 — Customer-message-to-brand linkage uses @-mention regex, not full id-graph resolution

**Decision:** For Phase 1's per-brand `customer_messages` count, a customer
tweet is attributed to a brand if its text contains an `@handle` mention
matching that brand's account name (case-insensitive), rather than by
resolving `in_response_to_tweet_id` through a full tweet-id → author-id
index built over all 2.8M rows.

**Reason:** This is a well-known, simple convention for this dataset (a
customer's tweet addressed to support almost always @-mentions the handle)
and only requires a single regex pass over the `text` column — no need to
hold a multi-million-entry id map in memory just to answer "roughly how much
volume does each candidate brand have."

**Alternatives considered:** Building a global `tweet_id -> author_id` map
to resolve replies exactly — deferred to Phase 3 (conversation
reconstruction), where exact linkage actually matters for building the
support-case records the system will use as evidence. For Phase 1's purpose
(comparing candidate brands), the mention-based approximation is sufficient
and keeps the script simple.

**Trade-off:** A small number of customer tweets that reply to a brand
without repeating the @-mention in text (rare, since Twitter's reply UI
auto-inserts the mention) will be undercounted. Not material at this stage.

## 2026-09-09 — Selected brand: SpotifyCares

**Decision:** `SpotifyCares` is the one brand this entire project is built
around (`SELECTED_BRAND=SpotifyCares` in `.env`). Scope: 43,265 brand
tweets, 43,243 of which are direct replies ("conversations"), and 31,308
customer tweets that @-mention the account, out of the full ~2.8M-tweet
dataset (see `data/processed/brand_statistics.csv`). Only this subset will
be used for the knowledge index, intent discovery, and the golden set going
forward — not the full dataset.

**Reason:** Evaluated against the Phase 2 selection criteria (sufficient
volume, clear support interactions, diverse-but-understandable problems,
consistent historical resolutions, enough data for splits, minimal noise),
against the four other Phase 1 candidates (`docs/brand_shortlist.md`):
- SpotifyCares showed the richest *in-thread* troubleshooting content of any
  candidate — real multi-turn diagnostic exchanges (device/OS/version
  questions, a restart step, a follow-up when the issue recurs — see
  `data/processed/sample_conversations.txt`), not just "please DM us"
  deflections. This matters directly for grounded reply generation: the
  system can only ground replies in what the historical `brand_response`
  text actually contains.
- It's a single global consumer product (a streaming subscription service)
  with no jurisdiction-specific policy (unlike Tesco's UK alcohol law or
  Delta's aviation regulations), which lowers the risk of the LLM needing
  external policy knowledge it doesn't have and shouldn't invent.
- Its problem space is naturally bounded and maps cleanly onto the target
  8–15 intents: playback/streaming issues, account/login, billing/subscription,
  device compatibility, ads, password reset — without the sprawl seen in
  AmazonHelp (orders, devices, Prime, sellers, payments, fraud all mixed
  together) or Delta (many threads need real-time facts like current flight
  status that can't safely be part of a "grounded" answer).
- 43k conversations is comfortably enough for a knowledge index + a
  150–250-example golden set with room to spare, while being *small enough*
  to keep the whole pipeline easy to build, inspect, and explain live — in
  line with the instruction to prefer simple, reproducible solutions over
  maximizing scale.

**Alternatives considered:**
- `AmazonHelp` — largest volume (169k conversations) but rejected: too
  heterogeneous a problem space for a tight 8–15 intent taxonomy, and its
  size adds no real benefit here since 43k is already far more than needed.
- `AppleSupport` — largest reply-ratio and volume among tech brands, but
  rejected: sample threads are dominated by single-turn "DM us" deflections
  with little resolvable content, which would starve grounded generation of
  real evidence.
- `Tesco` — rich, human complaint text, but rejected: spans website/IT
  issues, delivery, and UK-specific in-store policy (e.g. Think25 alcohol
  verification), adding jurisdiction-specific policy risk without a
  corresponding benefit over SpotifyCares.
- `Delta` — good diversity, but rejected: many threads hinge on real-time,
  case-specific facts (flight status, confirmation numbers) that push most
  cases toward mandatory escalation, limiting how well the project can
  demonstrate the auto-handle path.

**Trade-off:** Smaller absolute volume than Amazon/Apple/Delta/Tesco means
less headroom if a much larger knowledge base turns out to be needed later,
and Spotify's intents (streaming/technical) are narrower in scope than a
multi-category retailer's — acceptable since the assignment explicitly asks
for a justified subset, not maximum scale. Per the Phase 2 instruction, this
brand will not be changed unless a serious data problem surfaces during
later phases.
