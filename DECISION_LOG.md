# Decision Log

Non-obvious engineering decisions made throughout the project, in
chronological order. Each entry: decision, reason, alternatives considered,
trade-off.

## 2026-09-09 — Project structure follows the provided architecture spec exactly

**Decision:** Use the directory layout from
`Hiver_SDE_Project_Architecture_for_Claude_Code.md` section 4 verbatim
(`src/{data,intents,retrieval,generation,escalation}`, `baselines/`,
`evaluation/`, `scripts/`, `app/`, `tests/`, `artifacts/`, `docs/`).

**Reason:** The spec was clearly designed so each pipeline stage
(classification, retrieval, generation, escalation) is independently
testable and explainable, which matters for a live interview walkthrough.

**Alternatives considered:** A flatter `src/` with fewer subpackages — rejected
because it would blur the boundary between components the assignment
explicitly wants kept separate (see architecture doc section 25).

**Trade-off:** More boilerplate `__init__.py`/folders up front for a project
that starts empty, in exchange for a structure that won't need reshuffling
later.

## 2026-09-09 — Centralized config via `src/config.py` + `.env`, no per-module env reads

**Decision:** All environment-variable-driven settings (API keys, model
names, thresholds, paths, random seed) are read once into a frozen
`Settings` dataclass in `src/config.py`, exposed as a module-level `settings`
singleton.

**Reason:** The assignment requires configurable thresholds (not hard-coded)
and reproducible seeds; centralizing this in one place makes it auditable
and prevents drift where different modules read the same env var
differently.

**Alternatives considered:** `pydantic-settings` — deferred for now since
`pydantic` is already a dependency for later structured-output schemas, but
a plain frozen dataclass is simpler to explain live and has no additional
dependency surface for Phase 0.

**Trade-off:** Slightly less validation than a pydantic `BaseSettings` model
would give (e.g. no automatic type coercion errors), acceptable at this
stage since there are few settings.

## 2026-09-09 — golden set data path is git-tracked; raw/processed data paths are not

**Decision:** `.gitignore` excludes `data/raw/*` and `data/processed/*.{jsonl,csv}`
but leaves `data/golden/` untouched so the golden evaluation set can be
committed once created.

**Reason:** Raw Twitter data and large processed derivatives shouldn't be
committed (repo size, licensing), but the 150–250-example golden set is a
required deliverable and needs to ship with the repo for reproducibility.

**Alternatives considered:** Committing a small processed data subset too —
deferred to Phase 20 (reproducibility check), where the exact
evaluation-ready subset to ship will be decided.

**Trade-off:** None for the golden set once labeled — this only needs
noting in case it's obscured by `.gitignore` later.
